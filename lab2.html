		<h3>Task 1</h3>
		
		<p>Identifying my Audience:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b> Does the focus of your topic lend itself to particular audiences? What makes you think this?</b></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		This topic would lend itself to teachers as it would give them an idea of how games can be used in education.
		<br><br>
		I think it would also potentially lend itself to game developers, to give them an idea of why developing educational games could be a good thing. 
		</p>	
			

		<ul>
			<li><b>Whether you want to focus on a broad or narrow audience?</b></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		I would prefer to narrow down my audience. With teachers, I would like to limit the age so that I don’t need to address such a large age range on my website. 
		<br><br>
		For game developers I would like to do the same in limiting the age range. I would choose to do this with a younger age group as these people would recently be out of education and might have a better idea in what kind of educational games would suit the current day better. 
		</p>	
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Whether the audience is likely to have pre-existing expectations about the topic?</b></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Some teachers could have pre-conceived ideas about using games in education. Whether they think it is useful or if they believe it isn’t possible to use games in an educational way. 
		<br><br>
		Game developers might have seen or developed educational games before. Others might not think it is worth making an educational game. 
		</p>	
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>What types of audience do you have regular access to in order to facilitate user testing?</b></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		I would potentially be able to distribute to a couple of the teachers in the target audience. 
		<br><br>
		I know some computing science students (unsure whether they are interested in game development). 
		</p>	
		
		
		<br>
		
		<p>
		<b>Audience 1:</b> Teachers (of both primary and high school) <br>
		<b>Age:</b> 25 – 40 (retirement age of teachers usually around 60)<br>
		<b>Gender:</b> Mixed genders <br>
		<b>Language Proficiency:</b> Good language proficiency <br>
		<b>Education level:</b> Graduated with degree <br>
		<b>Attitude towards writer or organisation:</b> The audience might be sceptical in terms of not trusting a games ability to get information across to students. <br>
		<b>Knowledge of topic:</b> Some teachers might have some experience; others might not have much.<br>
		<b>Audience action:</b> I would hope that this audience would then use this information to pick out appropriate games for the age group/subject that they teach to use in their lessons. <br>

		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>
		<b>Audience 2:</b> Game developers (could be aspiring) <br>
		<b>Age:</b> 20 - 30 <br>
		<b>Gender:</b> Mixed genders <br>
		<b>Language Proficiency:</b> Good language proficiency <br>
		<b>Education level:</b> In or graduated from further education – some experience in coding<br>
		<b>Attitude towards writer or organisation:</b> Some of the audience might be interested, others sceptical about creating a game for education purposes.  <br>
		<b>Knowledge of topic:</b> Some knowledge in games, not as much knowledge in educational games. <br>
		<b>Audience action:</b>Developers or inspiring developers might begin to think about designing educational games. <br>

		<b>User Stories:</b><br>
		<u>Cate Theron</u><br>
		As a primary school teacher,<br>
		I would like a resource to give me new ideas for when I’m teaching.<br>
		So that, I can trial this method with my class and see if it helps them in learning difficult or boring topics. <br>
		<br>
		As a primary school teacher,<br>
		I would like a resource to show me whether a game is a good method to teach my class something.  <br>
		So that, I know whether it will help them in their learning or just distract them. <br>

		
		
		<br>
		<u>Lana Moore</u><br>
		As an aspiring game developer, <br>
		I would like to know what educational games exist already.<br>
		So that, I have a better idea of what to make an educational game about. <br>
		<br>
		
		As an aspiring game developer, <br>
		I would like to know if educational games are useful or not.<br>
		So that, I know whether there is worth in me making one. <br>



		<br>
		<br>
		<b>User Needs:</b><br>
		<u>Cate Theron</u><br>
		Cate, a primary teacher with a flair for creativity... <br>
		<br>
		...needs to see examples of different educational games beside their topic in order to determine if any would be useful for her class. <br>
		...needs to easily sort through information on why educational games are useful in order to make sure it will be beneficial alongside her teaching. <br>
		...needs to easily find examples of educational games under certain topics in order to quickly find ones suited to the topic she is teaching. 
		...needs to see further information beside each game in order to find out what skills each game helps to improve.

		<h3>Task 1</h3><br>
		<p>
		Website 1 - <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu">Yale Art</a><br>
		
		Website 2 - <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com">Smashing Machine</a><br>
		
		<br>
		<b>Analysis of the website in terms of:</b> <br>
		<br>
		<i>Different layout, colours, and/or graphics</i><br>
		Website 1 has a navigation bar at the left side of the home page which remains in the same position on the different pages of the site. <br>
		Website 2 instead has a navigation bar at the top of the page which is consistent like website 1 when moving to other pages offering an easy way to get to different parts of the website.<br> 
		<br>
		<i>Contrasting structure or navigation</i><br>
		Website 1 doesn’t have a set colour scheme. Most of the text boxes and options are in different colours. There is no consistency with the colouring or layout. A lot of the text boxes are different sizes and in random places on the page, giving it a very unstructured look. <br>
		Website 2 has a nice colour scheme of mainly red and white. <br>
		The layout of the home page is nicely organised. There are different things to select on the page, and these are all grouped neatly, with no overlapping in different colours to make the different options easy to identify.  <br>
		They use graphics such as a magnifying glass in the search bar, making it easy to identify. They also have a logo at the far left of the navigation bar that takes you back to the home page when clicked. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Interesting types of interaction</i><br>
		There is a calendar function on website 1 on the home page that shows the school’s upcoming events. When an event is clicked it gives a drop down of more information about the event. <br>
		On website 2, there is a separate scrolling bar at the bottom of the home page to allow you to view different options available. <br>
