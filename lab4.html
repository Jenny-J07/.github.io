			I have reviewed over css by reading about some of the different pages on w3schools.<br>

			<summary>Task 1</summary>
			<br>
			I have created an external css file called main.css that is applied to all of the pages on this site. <br>
			I have been adding to this file progressively over the duration of the project and different lab tasks. <br>
			
			<br>
		</details>

		<details>
			<summary>Task 2</summary>
			<br>
			I have started by adding a navigation bar for easier organisation of the weekly tasks. This makes the site more accessible as you can quickly 
			swap between pages. <br>
			<br>
			The lab tasks are contained within a drop down menu, I did this so that the nav bar wouldn't look cluttered. When you hover over a button on the 
			navigation bar, it changes colour. I learned about this on w3schools. <br>
			When on a lab page, if you open the dropdown menu, the page you are on will be a different colour in the menu. This helps to remind users what 
			page they are on. I did this by using an id tag 'active' that when applied in the navbar class changes the colour of the item in the 
			dropdown menu.<br>
			
			<br>
			I have also tried to colour some of the elements. <br>
			I started by making the navigation bar light blue with white text. On reflection, the text was quite difficult so I have adjusted the colours. 
			The nav bar is now black with white text to allow the text to stand out. <br>
			<br>
			I have coloured all of the independent learning tasks the same, and made all of the lab tasks another colour. This is so that the pages are all 
			consistent. By having the IL and lab tasks different colours, this means they can be differentiated between. <br>
			<br>
			By conducting further research, I have also learned more about columns. By creating classes, I have created a triple-split column for my images 
			in the week 7 section. This helps to keep the page neat and organised. <br>
