		<h3>Task 1</h3>
		
		<p>
		<b>What will the audience take away from my website?</b><br>
		<br>
		My main focus for the narative of the site is to show teachers the benefits of educational games.<br>
		I would like teachers to then go away with this knowledge and be able to use games in their classrooms to benefit children.<br>
		I want to help give teachers ideas as to how to integrate the games into their lessons.<br>
		
		
		<br>
		I want to make the website interactive.<br>
		For example, to have a title - 'Skills that can be developed through educational games'<br>
		that you can then click to show all of the different skills. <br>
		<br>
		I would like to incorporate changing graphics as the user scrolls down a page. <br>
		This could be used to highlight the different styles of games by having background images change as the user scrolls through the options.<br>
		<br>
		I also want to show teachers different options of educational games that they can use.<br>
		I would like to give a list of skills beside each game, giving an overview of what the game's topic is along with what skills it helps to improve.<br>
		I could use images alongside the list of skills on each game.<br>
		
		<br>
		<b>Reflective Statement:</b><br>
		When first navigating to the site, I want teachers to see some basic information about what the website is about, along with an overview<br>
		of the main benefits of educational games. I would then like to give them the option to look through further benefits and also <br>
		provide resources that give more information about this. This could be through an interactive scrolling feature on the website - <br>
		as the user scrolls down the page, the information cycles through different points. <br>
		<br>
		I also want to give the user information on how they can integrate games into lessons. This can include advice and guidance <br>
		for teachers who are unsure of how games work and how to demonstrate them to a class. <br>
		<br>
		I think it would be good to have different pages for this information. Such as a separate page for benefits of educational games <br>
		and another page with info and advice on integrating the games. This would help to break up the information and keep it <br>
		more organised. This would also mean the user doesn't need to take a lot of information in on one page.<br>
		This could be done through use of a navigation bar. The different headings could be highlighted at the top of <br>
		the home page, allowing users to swap between resources.<br>
		<br>
		At this stage I would like them to them see examples of games. These might be sorted by topic or skill and the user can then <br>
		browse through these to find what would be suitable for their class. This allows them to find specific games that are <br>
		relevant to what they are teaching. Hopefully keeping more teachers engaged if they can easily search through different games. <br>
		I would also like to attach further information to each game, such as:
		<ul>
			<li>a brief overview of the game (a description)</li>
			<li>the age range it's aimed at</li>
			<li>the skills it helps to develop</li>
			<li>the topic(s) it focuses on</li>
		</ul>
		I think a search function on the site would also be valuable to users. This would allow for them to search for specific game topics.<br>
		They could then click into each game to find out the further details. An image attached to each game title would help to make the site<br>
		(and games) more eye-catching.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<u>The main goal of the site is to inspire teachers to use educational games in their classrooms alongside lessons and to provide them with the resources to do so.
