		<p>
		<b>What will the audience take away from my website?</b><br>
		<br>
		My main focus for the narative of the site is to show teachers the benefits of educational games.<br>
		I would like teachers to then go away with this knowledge and be able to use games in their classrooms to benefit children.<br>
		I want to help give teachers ideas as to how to integrate the games into their lessons.<br>
		This will help if they are unsure of how to incorporate games into lessons, giving further instruction and guidance. <br>
		
		<br>
		I want to make the website interactive.<br>
		For example, to have a title - 'Skills that can be developed through educational games'<br>
		that you can then click to show all of the different skills. <br>
		I think this would be a good feature to help keep users engaged in the website. It means they can click on different sections that they want to read about. 
		It also means there isn't as much text on the main page, this helps to keep the page more minimal and not overwhelming for the user.<br>
		
		<br>
		I would like to incorporate changing graphics as the user scrolls down a page. <br>
		This could be used to highlight the different styles of games by having background images change as the user scrolls through the options.<br>
		I think this once again improves the interactivity of the site, helping to keep the target audience interested and engaged. <br>
		
		<br>
		
		I also want to show teachers different options of educational games that they can use.<br>
		I would like to give a list of skills beside each game, giving an overview of what the game's topic is along with what skills it helps to improve.<br>
		This is to make resources easily accessible for teachers. Rather than simply explaining why these games are beneficial but not providing examples, this 
		means they don't need to search the internet for games that would be appropriate for their classes. <br> 
		I could use images alongside the list of skills on each game.<br>
		Images might help the information comprehension for users. By providing images, these could give the user an overview of the games. <br> 
		
		<br>
		<b>Reflective Statement:</b><br>
		When first navigating to the site, I want teachers to see some basic information about what the website is about, along with an overview<br>
		of the main benefits of educational games. I would then like to give them the option to look through further benefits and also <br>
		provide resources that give more information about this. This could be through an interactive scrolling feature on the website - <br>
		as the user scrolls down the page, the information cycles through different points. <br>
		<br>
		I also want to give the user information on how they can integrate games into lessons. This can include advice and guidance <br>
		for teachers who are unsure of how games work and how to demonstrate them to a class. <br>
		<br>
		I think it would be good to have different pages for this information. Such as a separate page for benefits of educational games <br>
		and another page with info and advice on integrating the games. This would help to break up the information and keep it <br>
		more organised. This would also mean the user doesn't need to take a lot of information in on one page.<br>
		This could be done through use of a navigation bar. The different headings could be highlighted at the top of <br>
		the home page, allowing users to swap between resources.<br>
		<br>
		At this stage I would like them to them see examples of games. These might be sorted by topic or skill and the user can then <br>
		browse through these to find what would be suitable for their class. This allows them to find specific games that are <br>
		relevant to what they are teaching. Hopefully keeping more teachers engaged if they can easily search through different games. <br>
		I would also like to attach further information to each game, such as:
		<ul>
			<li>a brief overview of the game (a description)</li>
			<li>the age range it's aimed at</li>
			<li>the skills it helps to develop</li>
			<li>the topic(s) it focuses on</li>
		</ul>
		I think a search function on the site would also be valuable to users. This would allow for them to search for specific game topics.<br>
		They could then click into each game to find out the further details. An image attached to each game title would help to make the site<br>
		(and games) more eye-catching.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<u>The main goal of the site is to inspire teachers to use educational games in their classrooms alongside lessons and to provide them with the resources to do so. </u>

		<summary>Project Consultation Notes</summary>
		<br>
		These are some notes of things discussed in my project consultation.<br>
		<br>
		The register of the language I use in the website. <br>
		I need to consider what language I use in terms of exam and grading terminology. <br>
		<br>
		I also need to consider how broad my project could become in terms of the level of content. <br>
		How many subjects am I going to include game examples for? Given the amount of subject choices available, this could become very broad if I try and 
		include them all. <br>
		I also need to think about how many game examples I will provide for each topic/subject area. <br>
		This might depend on how many different games are available for each subject. <br>
		<br>
		Do I want to include games that could be used in educational purposed or just educational games.<br>
		Games such as Minecraft could be used for education, but it is not a specific educational game. <br>
		<br>
		I need to decide what school system I would like to focus on e.g. English or Scottish - they have different examination types. <br>
		I think I would like to focus on the Scottish school system as I know more about this system.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Overall, I found this meeting very helpful. It made me think about things that I hadn't considered before this point regarding the scope and scale of 
		my project <br>
